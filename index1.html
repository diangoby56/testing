<p style="margin:2%;">The students at The Schoolhouse are men and women ages 18-40, refugees, asylum seekers or migrants, from countries which they fled or left for reasons of life danger, persecution, oppression, poverty, or lack of freedom, or equal opportunity. The majority of our students are from origin countries; Sudan and Eritrea. We also have students from: Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Bolivia, Venezuela and more. 
	Their educational background varies, ranging from those whom have never been to school before, to University graduates. There are quite a few autodeducts.
	Many left their countries unexpectedly and have since been coping with survival challenges, physical or mental illness without proper care, instability and the unknown, loneliness, cultural acclimation difficulties, and above all, great hopes and dreams for the future.  
	Our students have mostly survived against all odds, and are deeply motivated towards life. 

	Education is viewed as a significant tool for empowerment, independence, employment opportunity, and self- development, 
	all which will equip them with greater abilities for making an impact and creating a better future, for themselves, 
	the community around them, or back in their country of origin.

<h2>Schoolhouse</h2>
<article>
  <div class= "P">  
<p>The Schoolhouse promotes adult education for refugees, 
	asylum seekers and marginalized migrant populations in Israel.
<br>
<br>	
	Our ultimate goal is to see our students bringing advancements
	to society around them, developing careers or businesses, 
	working in higher salary work places, becoming influential 
	individuals within their communities or back in their countries 
	of origin, or simply developing into the people they want to be, 
	living the life they want to lead. 
</p>
<p> OUR STORY
<br>
	Between 2007-2011, as Africans from Sudan and Eritrea streamed 
	into Israel's Southern border seeking asylum and hopes for a better life,
	the Israeli government remained unprepared as to how to approach this new 
	migration challenge. 
	The struggles on behalf of human rights organizations focused on survival 
	needs, psycho-social attention, policy change, rights, medical treatment and more. 
	Yet many voices from within the African asylum seeker population were speaking 
	of education. There was a huge motivation to create a better future for themselves 
	and their communities and education was viewed as a significant tool for being able 
	to impact a change.
	The Schoolhouse educational model was created to develop adult education and 
	skills adapted to the particular needs of this community. 
	In January 2012, the first Schoolhouse English class began,
	together with partner organizations HIAS and Windows for Peace.
